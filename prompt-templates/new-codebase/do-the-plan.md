Review @plan.md and locate all prompts that remain unmarked as complete.

For each pending prompt:

Verify it requires implementation (request confirmation if status is unclear).
Skip if already implemented.
Otherwise, execute the prompt exactly as specified.
Ensure all tests pass and the application builds/runs successfully
Commit your work with a descriptive commit message.
Mark the prompt as completed in @prompt_plan.md.


Pause after completing each prompt for user validation and feedback.
Continue to the next incomplete prompt only when directed.
Approach each task with precision, implementing the most streamlined and minimal solution that preserves existing functionality.
