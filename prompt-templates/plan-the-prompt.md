Now create a detailed technical implementation plan for this project. Start by drafting the core architecture and technical approach, then decompose it into logical development phases that build systematically toward the complete solution. Each phase should represent a cohesive technical milestone that advances the overall system.

Review your breakdown and iterate on the sizing - ensure each phase tackles meaningful functionality while remaining technically manageable and reducing implementation risk. Focus on clean separation of concerns and logical dependency chains between components.

Once you have properly scoped phases, generate a sequence of developer prompts that will implement each technical milestone. Structure these prompts to enforce solid engineering practices: modular architecture, incremental integration, and cohesive code organization. Each prompt should build upon previous implementations and contribute to a unified, functional system.

Format your output with clear markdown sections. Wrap each developer prompt in code blocks for easy extraction. Include technical context and implementation rationale alongside the coding instructions - developers need architectural understanding not just feature requirements.

Save your complete blueprint as plan.md and create todo.md for tracking implementation progress.
