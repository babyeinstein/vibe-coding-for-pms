Guide me through creating a minimun viable specification for this idea by asking focused questions one at a time. 

Each question should deepen our understanding based on my responses, working toward a complete spec that's ready for development handoff. We'll explore this systematically, covering all essential aspects through this iterative process. Stick to one question at a time.

When finished, export our work to spec.md

Ask if I'd like to establish a GitHub repository. If yes, initialize the repo, commit spec.md, and push to the new remote repository.

Here is the idea: <idea>
