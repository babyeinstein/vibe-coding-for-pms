Create a step-by-step implementation plan for this change. Break it into small, safe phases that can each be shipped independently.

**Plan Requirements:**
- Work with existing code patterns (don't reinvent the wheel)
- Ship incrementally with rollback options
- Each phase should deliver value or reduce risk

**For each phase, create a developer prompt that includes:**
- What files/functions to change
- How to test the changes
- How to verify it works

**Output format:**
- Save as `plan.md` with clear phases
- Create `todo.md` with specific file paths to modify
