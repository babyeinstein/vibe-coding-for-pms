Guide me through refining a minimum viable change (MVC) for this idea within the existing codebase by asking focused questions one at a time.

Each question should build on my previous answers and be grounded in the current repository's architecture, conventions, and constraints. The goal is to produce a clear, incremental plan that is feasible to implement and ship safely via a short-lived branch and PR.

Here is the idea (to be implemented in the existing codebase): <idea>


When finished:
-Now that we’ve wrapped up the brainstorming process, can you compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification? 
 
- Export the agreed plan to spec.md (include scope)
