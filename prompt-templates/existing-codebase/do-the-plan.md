Review @plan.md and locate all tasks that remain unmarked as complete.

For each pending task:

Verify it requires implementation (request confirmation if status is unclear).
Skip if already implemented or if existing code already handles this functionality.
Otherwise, execute the task exactly as specified, working within the existing codebase patterns.
Ensure all existing tests still pass and no regressions are introduced.
Run the application to verify the change works as expected.
Mark the task as completed in @plan.md.

Pause after completing each task for user validation and feedback.
Continue to the next incomplete task only when directed.
Approach each change with precision, implementing the most minimal solution that integrates cleanly with existing functionality and maintains backward compatibility.
